Dear Mr. Johnson,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the availability of the conference room at your hotel for a business meeting on May 5th. We are planning a day-long event and would like to accommodate 50 people.

Could you please provide me with the following information:
- The cost to rent the conference room for the entire day
- Whether you can provide catering services for lunch and coffee breaks
- The type of audio-visual equipment available at the venue
- Parking options for our attendees

Additionally, I would like to receive a copy of your event guidelines and policies. Please send it to my email address, and let me know if you have any special requirements or limitations we should be aware of.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Maaike van Putten
